Feature implementations
* Move our one and only channel from directly mapping into the synth so that it resides on an axis of an input device. 
* Then recode the synth classes to be able to run multiple channels
* Find an easier way to make the synth stop. Currnetly you need to go into the settings to turn it off. 

Improvements
* Convert from threads to queues
* Change all instances of "Gyros" or "Gyro" to Gyroscope

Bug fixes
* Get rid of the pop associated with the synth sample looping around
